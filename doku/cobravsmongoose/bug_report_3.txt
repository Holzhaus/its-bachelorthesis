Hi,

thanks for the quick answer.

It is my understanding that your gem is based on the badgerfish
convention for converting XML into JSON and vice versa. I found
CobraVsMongoose because it was mentioned as an implementation of said
convention here: http://www.sklar.com/badgerfish/

I compare different XML-to-JSON round-trip conversion methods and wanted
to include Badgerfish in that comparison. I couldn't get the Lua script
working and the PHP implementation can't convert JSON back to XML since it
does not have a decode() method. Your ruby gem was the only one that did work
at least for simple XML documents.

Honestly, I can't tell you if you should continue to maintain it. My use
of it would be rather superficial and limited, and thus I'm not sure if
that'd be worth the effort if you neither use CobraVsMongoose yourself
nor do know of anyone else who uses it.  I have my fair share of
abandoned open-source projects myself, and can totally understand if you
decide against it.


Best regards

Jan Holthuis
