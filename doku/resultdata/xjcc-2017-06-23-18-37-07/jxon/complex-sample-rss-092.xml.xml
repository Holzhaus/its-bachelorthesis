This is where we're experimenting with enclosures on RSS news items that download when you're not using your computer. If it works (it will) it will be the end of the Click-And-Wait multimedia experience on the Internet.</description><docs>http://backend.userland.com/rss092</docs><item><description>It's been a few days since I added a song to the Grateful Dead channel. Now that there are all these new Radio users, many of whom are tuned into this channel (it's #16 on the hotlist of upstreaming Radio users, there's no way of knowing how many non-upstreaming users are subscribing, have to do something about this..). Anyway, tonight's song is a live version of Weather Report Suite from Dick's Picks Volume 7. It's wistful music. Of course a beautiful song, oft-quoted here on Scripting News. &lt;i>A little change, the wind and rain.&lt;/i></description><enclosure length="6182912" type="audio/mpeg" url="http://www.scripting.com/mp3s/weatherReportDicksPicsVol7.mp3"/></item><item><description>Kevin Drennan started a &lt;a href="http://deadend.editthispage.com/">Grateful Dead Weblog&lt;/a>.

Somehow she made it to the age of 40 without ever hearing Wharf Rat. We drove to Jersey and back over Christmas with the live album commonly known as Skull and Roses in the CD player much of the way, and it was cool to see her discover one the band's finest moments. That song is unique and underappreciated. Fun to hear that disc again after a few years off -- you get Jerry as blues-guitar hero on Big Railroad Blues and a nice version of Bertha."</description><enclosure length="27503386" type="audio/mpeg" url="http://www.scripting.com/mp3s/darkStarWharfRat.mp3"/></item><item><description>&lt;a href="http://arts.ucsc.edu/GDead/AGDL/fotd.html">Tonight's Song&lt;/a>: "If I get home before daylight I just might get some sleep tonight."</description><enclosure length="3219742" type="audio/mpeg" url="http://www.scripting.com/mp3s/friendOfTheDevil.mp3"/></item><item><description>&lt;a href="http://arts.ucsc.edu/GDead/AGDL/uncle.html">Tonight's song&lt;/a>: "Come hear Uncle John's Band by the river side.
