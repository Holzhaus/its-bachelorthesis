Since in practice, all widely\nused character encodings fall into one of the categories above, the XML encoding\ndeclaration allows reasonably reliable in-band labeling of character encodings,\neven when external sources of information at the operating-system or transport-protocol\nlevel are unreliable. Character encodings such as UTF-7\nthat make overloaded usage of ASCII-valued bytes may fail to be reliably detected.","Once the processor has detected the character encoding in use, it can act\nappropriately, whether by invoking a separate input routine for each case,\nor by calling the proper conversion function on each character of input.","Like any self-labeling system, the XML encoding declaration will not work\nif any software changes the entity's character set or encoding without updating\nthe encoding declaration. Implementors of character-encoding routines should\nbe careful to ensure the accuracy of the internal and external information\nused to label the entity."],"table":[{"tbody":{"tr":[{"td":[{"code":"00 00 FE\nFF","__text":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},"UCS-4, big-endian machine (1234 order)"],"__text":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"td":[{"code":"FF\nFE 00 00","__text":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},"UCS-4, little-endian machine (4321 order)"],"__text":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"td":[{"code":"00 00 FF FE","__text":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},"UCS-4, unusual octet order (2143)"],"__text":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"td":[{"code":"FE FF 00 00","__text":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},"UCS-4, unusual octet order (3412)"],"__text":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"td":[{"code":"FE FF ## ##","__text":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},"UTF-16, big-endian"],"__text":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"td":[{"code":"FF FE ## ##","__text":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},"UTF-16, little-endian"],"__text":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"td":[{"code":"EF BB BF","__text":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},"UTF-8"],"__text":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t"}],"__text":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t"},"_border":"1","_frame":"border","__text":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t"},{"tbody":{"tr":[{"td":[{"code":"00¬†00¬†00¬†3C","__text":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"},{"_rowspan":"4","__text":"UCS-4 or other encoding with a 32-bit code unit and ASCII\ncharacters encoded as ASCII values, in respectively big-endian (1234), little-endian\n(4321) and two unusual byte orders (2143 and 3412).
