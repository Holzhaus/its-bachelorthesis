Xml, as the traditional data load format, needs to be resolved by DOM (Document Object Model ) both in client-side and server-side, which wastes system resource and makes a great reduction of user-friendliness. In this paper, a light-weightdata-interchanging format-JSON (Java Script Object Notation) will be introduced, which provides a higher level of flexibility and efficiency. We make a comparison between JSON and XML through expriment, then use JSON as data-transfering format in an actual project. Results show that JSON is more suitable as a data-loading tool for Ajax applications.},

Choosing proper data transmission format can effectively shorten the analyzing time, reduce data file redundancy, and bring much convenience to system development and maintenance. Experiments show that when analyzing JSON type data objects, the computer spend less time than XML data type and more time than HTML fragments, but with low file redundancy and more convenience for programming and maintaining. So in some cases, use JSON data type as transmission type will bring faster user experience, and cost on development and maintenance also can be reduced.},

XML has numerous benefits including human-readable structures and self-describing data. However, JSON provides significant performance gains over XML due to its light weight nature and native support for JavaScript. This is especially important for Rich Internet Applications (RIA). Therefore, it is necessary to change the data format from XML to JSON for efficiency purposes. This paper presents a refactoring system (XtoJ) to safely assist programmers migrate existing AJAX-based applications utilizing XML into functionally equivalent AJAX-based applications utilizing JSON. We empirically demonstrate that our transformation system significantly improves the efficiency of AJAX applications.},

The features of these two data objects were analyzed and it was point out that how to translate correctly between these two objects. A recursive algorithm used to translate between these two types of data serializing forms was given based on the multi-tree data structure of XML and JSON objects. The efficiency of this algorithm was proved by translation experiments. When applied in web applications, this paper gives how to add the translation method in system structures of the applications. It gives how this method can improve system structure and the performance of the web applications.},
